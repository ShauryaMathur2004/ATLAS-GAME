# 🌍 Atlas Game

A simple and fun word game built with Python and Tkinter where you and the bot take turns naming places. Each new place must start with the last letter of the previous place. Play continues until the bot runs out of options!

## 🎮 How to Play

- You enter a **valid place name**.
- The bot responds with another place starting with the **last letter** of your input.
- You and the bot keep alternating turns.
- The same place **cannot be repeated**.
- If the bot can't find a valid place, **you win! 🎉**
